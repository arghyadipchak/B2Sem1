Suppose X1,...Xn are iid exp(λ). Find the method of moments estimator of the rate  λ based on the first moment.

For n=4 and λ=2, generate 1000 samples and find the method of moments estimator for each sample. Draw a QQ-plot of these estimators against the normal distribution with the fitted line.

Repeat with n=100.

Submit derivation of first part, codes, plots, and summary of observations.
