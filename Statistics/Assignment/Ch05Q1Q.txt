Find the binomial probability distribution (pmf) for n=100 and p=0.1. 

Find the normal approximation for each integer value of the variable above. 

Plot the two distributions with a side-by-side bar chart. 

It is enough to limit the support to [0:20] as beyond that the probabilities are very low. 

Submit the code and the plot.
