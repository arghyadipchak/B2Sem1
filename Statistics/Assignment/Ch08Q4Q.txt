An aircraft manufacturer requires bolts that are part of the landing gear assembly to have a mean diameter of 1.1 inches with a variance of no more than 0.04 inches2. The bolts are purchased from an outside supplier. A random sample of 30 bolts from a recently received shipment yielded a variance of 0.054 inches2. Should the shipment be returned? Perform the appropriate test of hypothesis at 0.05 level. State the null and alternative hypotheses, test statistic, critical region and conclusion.
