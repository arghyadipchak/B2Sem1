The aim is to estimate the difference between the means of two normal populations with equal but unknown variance.

Generate a sample of size 10 from N(0,1)

Generate another sample of size 20 from N(2,1), independent of the first sample.

Using the samples generated, create a 95% CI for the parameter of interest.

Repeat the above steps 100 times. How many of these intervals include the true parameter?

Plot these intervals and the true value of the parameter, as in the R code of Lecture 7.
